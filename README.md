# OpenAI Examples

Example codes and and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the 
[Open API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and 
[Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). To run these 
examples, you need contact head honcho in the company to get API key. 
Installing python and the followings are required. I recommend setting up a Python 
virtual environment for development. Refer to the below:

```bash
python -m venv venv
cd venv
```
Execute the activate.bat or activate.ps1 (just in case of powershell). Then, you
can see the (venv) prompt in your command window. Install the requirments for all the examples with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wishing you good luck.
